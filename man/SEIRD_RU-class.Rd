\description{
This class represents the SEIR model, showing how populations of susceptible,
exposed, infectious and recovered individuals evolve over time. The model
considers these populations in two types of communities: rural and urban.
This class considers the model where people DO NOT move between communities
but can infect people from the other community.

\section{Methods (by generic)}{
\itemize{
\item \code{initial_conditions}: Retrieves initial conditions of
SEIRD_RU model.

\item \code{initial_cases_deaths}: Retrieves initial cases and deaths of
SEIRD_RU model.

\item \code{transmission_parameters}: Retrieves transmission parameters of SEIR model.

\item \code{contact_rates}: Retrieves contact rates of SEIR model.

\item \code{country_demog}: Retrieves age demographics, if provided, of SEIR model.

\item \code{fraction_rural}: Retrieves fraction of the population that lives in a
rural environment of SEIR model.

\item \code{initial_conditions<-}: Setter method for initial conditions
(S0, E0, I0 and R0) for both communities in the SEIR model.

All initial conditions must sum up to 1.
If the initial conditions provided to do not sum to 1, an error is thrown.

\item \code{transmission_parameters<-}: Setter method for transmission parameters
(b, k, g, m and C) of the SEIR model.

If the transmission parameters provided to are not 1-dimensional an error is
thrown.

\item \code{contact_rates<-}: Setter method for contact matrices for
urban and rural communities in the SEIR model.
Matrices must be of type double.
NOTE: if inputting matrices, you MUST assign fraction_rural first, and you
must input full age demographics, i.e. you cannot only provide the fraction
of the population that is rural!

\item \code{country_demog<-}: Setter method for demographic data for urban
and rural communities in the SEIR model. both vectors together must sum to 1.

\item \code{run}: Solves ODEs of the SEIRD_RU specified
in object for the time points specified in times and integration method
specified in solve_method.

For the urban community:
\deqn{\frac{dS_U(t)}{dt} = - b S_U (I_U + I_Y) N_U C
                           - b S_U/f_urban I_U/f_urban N_U (1-C)}
\deqn{\frac{dE_U(t)}{dt} =  b S_U (I_U + I_Y) N_U C
                           + b S_U/f_urban I_U/f_urban N_U (1-C) -k E_U}
\deqn{\frac{dI_U(t)}{dt} = k E_U - (g + m) I_U}
\deqn{\frac{dR_U(t)}{dt} = g I_U}
\deqn{\frac{dC_U(t)}{dt} = b S_U (I_U + I_Y) N_U C
                           + b S_U/f_urban I_U/f_urban N_U (1-C)}
\deqn{\frac{dD_U(t)}{dt} = m I_U}

For the rural community:
\deqn{\frac{dS_Y(t)}{dt} = - b S_Y (I_U + I_Y) N_Y C
                           - b S_Y/f_rural I_Y/f_rural N_Y (1-C)}
\deqn{\frac{dE_Y(t)}{dt} =   b S_Y (I_U + I_Y) N_Y C
                           + b S_Y/f_rural I_Y/f_rural N_Y (1-C) - k E_Y}
\deqn{\frac{dI_Y(t)}{dt} = k E_Y - (g + m) I_Y}
\deqn{\frac{dR_Y(t)}{dt} = g I_Y}
\deqn{\frac{dC_Y(t)}{dt} =  b S_Y (I_U + I_Y) N_Y C
                           + b S_Y/f_rural I_Y/f_rural N_Y (1-C)}
\deqn{\frac{dD_Y(t)}{dt} = m I_Y}

This function relies on the package deSolve.

\item \code{R0}: Returns the value of R0, the basic reproduction number,
for the model with the specified parameter values.
R0 is computed using the next generation matrix method as set out in
van den Driessche (2017):
van  den  Driessche, P. Reproduction numbers of infectious disease models.
Infectious Disease Modelling, 2:288â€“303, 8 2017.

In this method, the variables are split into two groups: those that represent
infected individuals (in our case the exposed and infectious compartments in
both communities), and those that do not (the susceptible, recovered and dead).
We only further consider the system of equations consisting of the ODEs
describing the variables in the first group,
in this case (E_U, E_Y, I_U and I_Y).
The differential equations for the variables in the first group are written
in the form
\deqn{\frac{dx_i}{dt} = F_i - V_i}
where F_i are the terms describing new cases of infection and V_i the terms
describing how individuals move between infected and other compartments.
We compute the matrices matF and matV as
\deqn{matF = \partial F_i(x_0)/\partial x_j}
\deqn{matV = \partial V_i(x_0)/\partial x_j}
where x_j are all the variables representing infected individuals.
Finally, R0 is the spectral radius of the matrix FV^(-1). For a more
detailed description of this method, see van den Driessche (2017).

\item \code{ode_structure_diagram}: Prints a compartmental diagram for the SEIRD_RU model

Note that gamma is used in place of Y in subscripts for the rural model.
