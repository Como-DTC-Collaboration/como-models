\title{Solves ODEs of the SEIRD specified in object
for the time points specified in times and integration method specified in
solve_method.}
\usage{
run(object, times = seq(0, 100, by = 1), solve_method = "lsoda")
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class SEIRD}

\item{times}{(double) a sequence of time points at which the solution to
the system of ODEs should be returned. Must be of the form
seq(t_start, t_end, by=t_step). Default time series is seq(0, 100, by = 1).}

\item{solve_method}{(string) a string of chosen numerical integration method
for solving the ode system. Default is "lsoda" which is also the default for
the ode function in the deSolve package used in this function.}
}
\value{
two dataframes: one with the time steps, age range, time series of S,
E, I, R and D population fractions, and another with the time steps, age
range, time series of incidences and deaths as a fraction of the population.
}
\description{
\deqn{\frac{dS(t)}{dt} = - beta S(t) I(t)}
\deqn{\frac{dE(t)}{dt} =  beta S(t) I(t) - kappa E(t)}
\deqn{\frac{dI(t)}{dt} = kappa E(t) - (gamma + mu) I(t)}
\deqn{\frac{dR(t)}{dt} = gamma I(t)}
\deqn{\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = beta S(t) I(t)}
\deqn{\frac{dD(t)}{dt} = mu I(t)}
This function relies on the package deSolve.
