\details{
1/kappa is the typical latent period, i.e. the period in which an individual
is infected but not infectious. The latent period for the base variant is
estimated to be 5.5 days (Xin et al. 2021). The latent period for the Delta variant
is estimated to be around 3.7 days (Li et al. 2021). The incubation period for the
Omicron variant is estimated to be 3 days (Jansen 2021), but no estimate for the
latent period is currently available. Because the incubation period of the
delta variant is estimated to be approximately 0.6 days longer than its
latent period (Grant et al. 2021), we assume the latent period for omicron to
be 2.4 days. We thus obtain values of kappa for each of the
variants: for base kappa = 1/5.5, for Delta kappa = 1/3.7, and for
omicron kappa = 1/2.4.

We assume that on average 0.66\\% of individuals infected with the virus die
(Verity et al. 2020): this is termed an infection fatality ratio (IFR).
For age-structured models, we use age-specific IFR estimates
(Verity et al. 2020).
Changing either gamma or mu affects both the rate at which
individuals recover or die and the proportions which recover or die.
As such, the implications of the individual parameter values are hard to
intuit without recourse to the other. Here, we choose a different
parameterisation that makes it simpler to set these parameters to
appropriate values:

gamma = zeta (1-IFR)
mu = zeta IFR

The proportion of infected individuals who go on to die due to infection
is given by the ratio of the rate of death to the overall rate out from the
infectious compartment, which is the definition of the IFR:

zeta = zeta IFR / (zeta IFR + zeta (1-IFR))
= IFR

The average duration spent in the infectious compartment is given by:\preformatted{1 / (zeta IFR + zeta (1-IFR)) = 1 / zeta
}

The duration of the infectious period is again difficult to estimate and
likely varies over variants. We will assume this time period to be
9 days, which is based on the base variant
(MacIntyre et al. 2021). So, we set zeta = 1/9.

The R0 of the base variant is assumed to be 2.4 in Report 9  (Ferguson et al. 2020).
Estimates of R0 for the delta variant range between
3.2 and 7, so we estimate it as 5 (Liu et al. 2021; Meng et al. 2021; Burki 2021).
Estimating R0 for Omicron is difficult with the many confounding variables like vaccine escape,
but a preliminary guess is 10 (Burki 2021).
